# Common Problem-Solving Strategies in Data Structures and Algorithms

## 1. Divide and Conquer

This strategy involves breaking a problem into smaller sub-problems, solving each independently, and combining their solutions.

- **Examples**: QuickSort, MergeSort, Binary Search.

## 2. Dynamic Programming

Used for optimization problems, it involves solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems.

- **Examples**: Fibonacci series, Longest Common Subsequence, 0/1 Knapsack Problem.

## 3. Greedy Algorithms

These make the locally optimal choice at each step, aiming for a global optimum.

- **Examples**: Huffman Coding, Prim’s Algorithm, Kruskal’s Algorithm.

## 4. Backtracking

An algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively, building a solution incrementally and abandoning it if it can't be completed.

- **Examples**: N-Queens Puzzle, Graph Colorings, Maze Problems.

## 5. Graph Algorithms

Techniques for working with graphs, including traversal and finding shortest paths.

- **Examples**: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Dijkstra’s Algorithm.

## 6. Hashing

Used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects, often in large datasets for quick operations.

- **Applications**: Quick search, insert, and delete operations.

## 7. Binary Search

A technique for quickly finding an item in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

- **Applications**: Searching in a sorted array.

## 8. Bit Manipulation

Using bitwise operations for efficient computation, especially in lower-level programming.

- **Applications**: Efficient storage and manipulation of data.
