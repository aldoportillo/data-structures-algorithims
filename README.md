# Data Structures and Algorithm Practice

## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of practice problems and solutions encompassing a wide range of data structures and algorithms. Each solution is accompanied by an analysis of its time and space complexity using Big O notation. The solutions are structured in a way that presents a straightforward approach initially, followed by a more optimized solution, facilitating a progressive understanding of the problem-solving process.
